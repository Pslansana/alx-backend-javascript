![Array in JavaScript Meme](https://images.ctfassets.net/pzhspng2mvip/7jcF7XfduV9XgOImKsxXRk/f7a3712b11485e2aadb1d1bfa5fe3fe9/arrays-everywhere.jpg)

## Overview

This project explores key concepts of **ES6** data manipulation in JavaScript, with a focus on **arrays**, **typed arrays**, and **data structures** such as **Set**, **Map**, and **WeakMap**. The project aims to develop a deep understanding of how to manipulate data effectively using modern JavaScript features.

The main learning objectives of the project include:

- Using **map**, **filter**, and **reduce** methods on arrays.
- Understanding and working with **typed arrays**.
- Mastering the usage of **Set**, **Map**, and **WeakMap** data structures in JavaScript.

## Project Details

- **Project Title**: 0x03. ES6 Data Manipulation
- **Duration**: Oct 7, 2024 3:00 AM to Oct 9, 2024 3:00 AM
- **Weight**: 1
- **Auto Review**: The auto-review will be launched at the deadline.

### Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to:

- **Use map, filter, and reduce on arrays**:
  - Understand how to iterate over arrays and modify their elements using these powerful methods.
- **Typed Arrays**:
  - Work with typed arrays and understand the difference between them and regular arrays in terms of performance and use cases.
- **Set, Map, and WeakMap Data Structures**:
  - Use the **Set** data structure to store unique values.
  - Implement the **Map** data structure for key-value pairs.
  - Work with **WeakMap** for more memory-efficient mappings when keys are objects.

## Resources

To prepare for this project, you should study the following materials:

- **Array**: Learn about array manipulation methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc.
- **Typed Arrays**: Learn how typed arrays differ from regular arrays and their use cases.
- **Set Data Structure**: Understand how to store unique values using the `Set` object.
- **Map Data Structure**: Learn how to use the `Map` object for key-value pairs.
- **WeakMap**: Understand the differences and use cases of the `WeakMap` object.

You can refer to the following documentation and resources:

- [MDN Web Docs: Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)
- [MDN Web Docs: WeakMap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap)

## Mandatory Requirements

To complete the project, you must meet the following mandatory requirements:

- Implement and demonstrate your knowledge of **map**, **filter**, and **reduce** methods on arrays.
- Work with **typed arrays** and show an understanding of their usage.
- Properly use **Set**, **Map**, and **WeakMap** data structures in your solutions.

## Optional Requirements

There are also optional tasks, which may be assessed during the review. These are designed to further expand your knowledge of ES6 features, but they are not mandatory for completing the project.

## Instructions

1. **Create and Modify Arrays**:
   - Implement solutions using the `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` methods to manipulate arrays.
2. **Typed Arrays**:
   - Create and manipulate typed arrays.
3. **Set, Map, and WeakMap**:
   - Use **Set** to store unique values.
   - Use **Map** to implement key-value pairs.
   - Utilize **WeakMap** for key-value storage with memory efficiency.
