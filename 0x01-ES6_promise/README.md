# ES6 Promises in JavaScript

![JavaScript Promises](https://shinesolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/babel_meme.jpg?w=300)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on mastering ES6 Promises in JavaScript, a powerful feature for handling asynchronous operations. By working through this project, you'll learn how to create, use, and handle Promises effectively, which is essential for working with APIs, managing asynchronous tasks, and building responsive applications.

- **Project Start**: October 1, 2024
- **Project Deadline**: October 3, 2024

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
1. Understand **Promises**—what they are, why they’re used, and how to implement them.
2. Use the `then`, `resolve`, and `catch` methods to handle asynchronous results and errors.
3. Apply every method of the Promise object effectively.
4. Use **Throw / Try** statements for error handling.
5. Utilize the **await** operator and **async functions** for cleaner, more readable asynchronous code.

## Prerequisites
To complete this project, you should have a foundational understanding of JavaScript, particularly:
- Variables and basic data types
- Functions and function expressions
- Control flow (loops and conditionals)

## Project Requirements
- Implement functions that return Promises.
- Chain multiple `.then()` calls to handle asynchronous sequences.
- Use `.catch()` to manage and handle errors in Promises.
- Explore `async` and `await` syntax for a more synchronous style of asynchronous code.

## Example Usage
```javascript
// Example: Basic Promise Usage
const asyncOperation = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Operation successful!");
  }, 1000);
});

asyncOperation
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.error("Error:", error));
