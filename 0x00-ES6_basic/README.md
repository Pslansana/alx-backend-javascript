# 0x00 ES6 Basics

This project covers the basics of ECMAScript 6 (ES6) features and syntax improvements. The aim is to provide a solid foundation for writing cleaner, more efficient JavaScript code using modern features introduced in ES6.

## Mandatory Tasks

### 1. Const or let?
Learn how and when to use `const` and `let` for variable declarations instead of `var` to ensure better scoping and immutability where needed.

### 2. Block Scope
Understand block-level scoping in ES6 with `let` and `const`, which restricts variables and constants to the block in which they are defined.

### 3. Arrow Functions
Explore how arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for function expressions and how they handle the `this` keyword differently compared to regular functions.

### 4. Parameter Defaults
Learn to set default values for function parameters in case they are not provided, improving function usability and reducing the need for manual default checks.

### 5. Rest Parameter Syntax for Functions
Master the use of the rest parameter syntax (`...`) to gather arguments into an array, making it easier to handle variable-length function arguments.

### 6. The Wonders of Spread Syntax
Understand the spread syntax (`...`) for expanding iterable objects into individual elements, useful for arrays, objects, and function arguments.

### 7. Take Advantage of Template Literals
Make use of template literals for more readable and flexible string interpolation, which supports embedding variables and expressions within strings.

### 8. Object Property Value Shorthand Syntax
Learn the shorthand syntax for object property definitions when the property name is the same as the variable name, making object literals more concise.

### 9. No Need to Create Empty Objects Before Adding Properties
In ES6, objects can be initialized with properties right away, eliminating the need to create empty objects and add properties later.

### 10. ES6 Method Properties
Discover how ES6 allows methods to be defined directly inside objects without using the `function` keyword.

### 11. For...of Loops
Get familiar with the `for...of` loop, which iterates over iterable objects like arrays, strings, and maps, providing a more concise way to work with collections.

### 12. Iterator
Understand the concept of iterators and how they work in conjunction with the `for...of` loop for custom iteration logic.

### 13. Let's Create a Report Object
Learn to create complex objects in ES6 that incorporate multiple ES6 features such as shorthand syntax, methods, and default values.

## Advanced Tasks

### 14. Iterating Through Report Objects
Work on advanced iteration techniques for objects, using methods such as `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, and `Object.entries()` to iterate over properties and values.

### 15. Iterate Through Object
Delve into more complex object iteration patterns and handle nested objects, arrays within objects, and dynamic object structures efficiently
