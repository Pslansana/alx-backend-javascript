# 0x02. ES6 Classes

![ES6 Classes Meme](https://media.makeameme.org/created/to-english-class.jpg)

## Overview

This project covers **ES6 classes** and object-oriented programming (OOP) in JavaScript. You will learn how to define and use classes, create static methods, extend classes, and apply metaprogramming concepts. By mastering these topics, you'll be able to write clean, reusable, and scalable JavaScript code for modern applications.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Define a class using ES6 syntax.
- Add methods to a class, including static methods.
- Understand the purpose of static methods and when to use them.
- Extend a class from another class using `extends`.
- Utilize metaprogramming concepts such as symbols.
