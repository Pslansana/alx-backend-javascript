# Unit Tests in JavaScript

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the application of unit testing in JavaScript, specifically using Mocha, Chai, and Sinon. You will be working with Node.js and Express.js to create a small server and then write tests to ensure that its functionality works as expected. The project will cover key testing concepts such as spies, stubs, hooks, and testing asynchronous code.

The auto review will be launched at the deadline, and you are required to complete the mandatory tasks to proceed.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to confidently explain the following concepts without needing to look up references:

### 1. **How to use Mocha to write a test suite**
   - Mocha is a testing framework for Node.js that allows you to organize and execute tests. You'll learn how to create test suites using Mocha and how to structure your tests effectively.

### 2. **How to use different assertion libraries (Node or Chai)**
   - You will explore how to use assertion libraries like Chai to validate test results. Chai offers different styles of assertions like BDD (Behavior Driven Development) and TDD (Test Driven Development) for easier test writing.

### 3. **How to present long test suites**
   - As projects grow, tests can become lengthy and complex. You will learn best practices for managing long test suites, making them readable, modular, and maintainable.

### 4. **When and how to use spies**
   - Spies are used to monitor the behavior of functions. You will learn when to use spies to check if a function has been called, how many times it was called, and with which arguments.

### 5. **When and how to use stubs**
   - Stubs are used to replace functions with predefined behavior. You will learn when to use stubs to simulate functions and control their behavior in a test environment.

### 6. **What are hooks and when to use them**
   - Hooks are special Mocha functions that allow you to run code before or after each test or before/after all tests in a suite. You will learn how and when to use `before()`, `after()`, `beforeEach()`, and `afterEach()` hooks to set up or tear down your tests.

### 7. **Unit testing with Async functions**
   - You will learn how to write tests for asynchronous functions (such as those using callbacks, Promises, or async/await) to ensure they behave as expected.

### 8. **How to write integration tests with a small node server**
   - Integration tests ensure that different components of your application work together as expected. You will learn how to write tests that interact with a small Node.js server using Mocha and the `request` library to simulate HTTP requests and validate responses.

## Project Tasks

During this project, you will:

1. Set up a Node.js server using Express.js.
2. Write Mocha test suites for your server's endpoints.
3. Use Chai assertions to validate responses and behavior.
4. Implement Sinon to create spies, stubs, and mocks for unit testing.
5. Test asynchronous functions, ensuring proper handling of Promises and async/await.
6. Write integration tests for your Node.js server to validate the overall functionality of the application.
